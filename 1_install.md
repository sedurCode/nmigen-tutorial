# Install for Windows with WSL2

## Note for Windows Users

For windows users, install [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10). I recommend Ubuntu 20.04 LTS as a distro. Make sure you also enable WSL 2.

## Install all the things

> It's unfortunate that installation of everything you need isn't a one-click process... although [FPGAWars' Apio](http://fpgawars.github.io/) goes a long way towards doing this. I just think that while yosys and nMigen are undergoing constant positive updates, Apio doesn't keep up with them. In the meantime, we just install all the tools separately.

* Python: See below for Python 3.6+ on WSL.

* Install yosys, Symbiyosys, yices2, and z3.
  * Install the following in a location relative to the WSL partitioned directories such as /home/<uname>/wherever-fpga-tools
  * `sudo apt install curl`
  * Now follow the [instructions to install these](https://symbiyosys.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html). It is highly recommended to follow those instructions, especially for yosys since the git repo has many more fixes than the official release.
  * Note that when you see `-j$(nproc)`, it means to specify the number of processors your CPU has. You can't really go wrong by using `-j4`. You can go higher if you know you have more.
  * z3 takes a long time to compile. Go watch a YouTube video in the meantime.

* Install nMigen
  * `pip3 install wheel`
  * `pip3 install git+https://github.com/nmigen/nmigen`

* Signal viewer for simulation and formal verification
  * [gtkwave](https://sourceforge.net/projects/gtkwave/)
    * For WSL, get the Windows version unless you want to run an [X server](https://medium.com/@japheth.yates/the-complete-wsl2-gui-setup-2582828f4577).
    * The package for gtkwave for Windows gives you no clue how to install for Windows. Unzip the zip file into, say, C:, and then add C:\gtkwave\bin to your Windows path.

### For the FPGA developer

If you are planning to synthesize for an FPGA using open source tools, you need to install utilities for your chosen platform:

* [Lattice ice40 devices](http://www.clifford.at/icestorm/)
  * Install this prerequisite that is not in the instructions: `sudo apt-get install libeigen3-dev`
  * Install the other prerequisites as in the instructions.
  * Holy Odin, g++-8.3.0 that was installed on WSL **coredumps** when compiling icestorm. Le sigh.
    * `sudo apt-get install g++-7 gcc-7`
    * `sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/gcc gcc /usr/bin/gcc-8 60 --slave /usr/bin/g++ g++ /usr/bin/g++-8`
    * `sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/gcc gcc /usr/bin/gcc-7 50 --slave /usr/bin/g++ g++ /usr/bin/g++-7`
    * Switch to g++-7 before compiling icestorm: `sudo update-alternatives --config gcc`
  * **Now** follow the given instructions for installing icestorm and NextPNR.
  * For WSL, you will also need the Windows version of iceprog.exe, which is inside a zip file from [FPGAWars' toolchain-icestorm repository](https://github.com/FPGAwars/toolchain-icestorm/releases).
  * For Debian on WSL, you need to "fix" libQt5Core.so.5: `sudo strip --remove-section=.note.ABI-tag /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libQt5Core.so.5`. See [bug](https://github.com/Microsoft/WSL/issues/3023). So... use Ubuntu for WSL instead?

* [Lattice ECP5 devices](https://github.com/SymbiFlow/prjtrellis)

This tutorial does not cover using these tools, but it does cover using nMigen to generate output for these tools.

## Python and WSL

Python 2 and Python 3 are not compatible. This is why this happens:

* `python`, `pip` -> Python 2
* `python3`, `pip3` -> Python 3

On my freshly-installed WSL, the only version present is Python 3.8. If it is not on your version, you may want to upgrade to 3.8, but 3.6+ will work. Upgrading is beyond the scope of this document.

Now install some bare minimum tools:

```sh
sudo apt install python3-pip build-essential libssl-dev libffi-dev
```

In installing the yosys prerequisites, Python 2 will be installed. So be aware that when you want to run anything under Python 3, you must use `python3` (or `pip3` for installing), not `python` (or `pip`).

# Tip for vscode users:

Open File > Preferences > Settings, look for pylint args, and add:

```
--contextmanager-decorators=contextlib.contextmanager,nmigen.hdl.dsl._guardedcontextmanager
```

This is because pylint doesn't recognize that `nmigen.hdl.dsl._guardedcontextmanager` is a valid context manager. Otherwise pylint will complain for every `with m.If` statement.
